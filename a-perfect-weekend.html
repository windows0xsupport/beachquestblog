                <h2 class="beach-heading">Soft Sands and Calm Shores</h2>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Hilton Head Island is famous for its miles of beautiful shoreline. The beaches here are wide, clean,
                    and
                    incredibly inviting — perfect for long morning walks or relaxing afternoon sunbathing. The soft sand
                    and
                    gentle Atlantic waves create a soothing coastal environment that feels peaceful from the moment you
                    step
                    onto the shore. Families love the shallow water and easy beach access, while couples often enjoy
                    romantic strolls during sunset when the sky glows with warm colors.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Coligny Beach, one of the most visited spots on the island, offers comfortable amenities, scenic
                    views,
                    and easy access to nearby shops and cafés. Meanwhile, quieter areas like Burkes Beach and Islanders
                    Beach
                    Park provide peaceful escapes with plenty of open sand to unwind in solitude.
                </p>

                <h2 class="beach-heading">A Cyclist’s Paradise</h2>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    One of the most unique and enjoyable experiences on Hilton Head Island is biking. With over 60 miles
                    of
                    bike paths woven throughout the island, cycling is not just an activity — it’s one of the best ways
                    to
                    explore the region. The paths are smooth, shaded by trees, and connected to beaches, resorts, and
                    local
                    attractions, making it easy for visitors of all ages to enjoy a scenic ride.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Many travelers choose to rent bikes for the entire weekend and ride from their hotel or resort
                    straight
                    to the beach. The combination of fresh ocean air, gentle breezes, and views of lush marshlands makes
                    biking one of the island’s signature experiences.
                </p>

                    of golf memorable.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Even if you’re not an experienced golfer, many of the island’s resorts offer beginner-friendly
                    lessons
                    and driving ranges where you can practice while enjoying the natural beauty around you. For seasoned
                    players, the peaceful setting and excellent course design provide a rewarding game every time.
                </p>

                    dining
                    options to satisfy every taste. Waterfront restaurants are especially popular, as they allow

                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Many travelers choose to end their evenings at a seaside restaurant, where soft lighting, gentle
                    waves,
                    and cool breezes create a perfect atmosphere for a peaceful dinner. From casual beachside grills to
                    elegant coastal dining rooms, Hilton Head’s culinary offerings elevate the entire weekend
                    experience.

                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Travelers often encounter dolphins on boat tours, especially during calm mornings. The gentle
                    presence of
                    these marine animals adds to the island’s sense of tranquility, making nature exploration one of the
                    most
                    rewarding parts of any Hilton Head trip.
                </p>
