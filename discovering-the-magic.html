            <h2 class="beach-heading">Golden Sands and Iconic Views</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                Waikiki Beach stretches along the southern coast of Oahu, offering soft, golden sand that invites
                visitors to relax, sunbathe, or take a long stroll along the shore. The backdrop of Diamond Head
                Crater adds a dramatic and unmistakable silhouette to the horizon, making the beach one of the
                most photographed in the world. Whether arriving at sunrise for a peaceful morning walk or staying
                until sunset to watch the sky light up in vibrant hues, Waikiki’s shores provide endless visual
                delight.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">Surfing: Ride the Legendary Waves</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                Waikiki is famous for its gentle, rolling waves, which have made it a hub for both beginner and
                intermediate surfers. Many surf schools along the beach offer lessons, boards, and guidance for
                first-timers, giving everyone the chance to experience the thrill of standing on a board in the
                Pacific Ocean. Experienced surfers can also find areas nearby with slightly larger waves for a more
                challenging ride. Surfing in Waikiki is more than just a sport — it’s a way to connect with the
                ocean, embrace Hawaiian culture, and enjoy an unforgettable adventure.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">Shopping and Dining Along Kalākaua Avenue</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                Just steps from the sand, Kalākaua Avenue is Waikiki’s bustling heart, lined with shops, boutiques,
                and restaurants. From high-end luxury brands to charming local stores, shopping here is an
                experience that complements the relaxed beach lifestyle. Visitors can also savor a wide range of
                culinary delights, including fresh poke bowls, tropical fruit smoothies, Hawaiian barbecue, and
                international cuisine. The vibrant energy along Kalākaua Avenue makes it easy to transition from a
                day on the beach to an evening of dining, entertainment, or cultural exploration.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">Traditional Hawaiian Luaus and Cultural Experiences</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                Waikiki offers a window into Hawaiian culture with its many traditional luaus, hula performances,
                and music events. These celebrations are often held on the beach or at nearby resorts, featuring
                storytelling, traditional dances, and feasts that include kalua pork, poi, and fresh seafood.
                Attending a luau gives visitors a deeper appreciation of the Hawaiian heritage and creates memories
                that last a lifetime. From the rhythmic drumbeats to the colorful costumes, these cultural experiences
                blend beautifully with the natural charm of Waikiki Beach.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">Water Adventures Beyond Surfing</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                While surfing is the star attraction, Waikiki also offers a variety of other water activities.
                Visitors can try stand-up paddleboarding, snorkeling among coral reefs, outrigger canoe rides, and
                even whale-watching tours during the migration season. Each adventure provides a unique perspective
                of the island’s marine life and coastal beauty, ensuring there’s something for every type of ocean
                enthusiast.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">Exploring the Surrounding Areas</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                Waikiki is not just a beach — it’s the gateway to exploring the southern coast of Oahu. A short drive
                brings travelers to Diamond Head State Monument, where a hike rewards you with panoramic views of
                Waikiki and the Pacific. Nearby parks, botanical gardens, and historic sites also offer opportunities
                to enjoy nature, wildlife, and Hawaiian history. Even a simple walk through the streets around the
                beach reveals charming cafés, art galleries, and hidden gems waiting to be discovered.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">Sunsets That Captivate</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                One of Waikiki’s most magical experiences is watching the sun set over the Pacific. As the day winds
                down, the sky is painted in brilliant oranges, pinks, and purples, reflecting on the water and
                creating a perfect moment to pause and reflect. Many visitors enjoy this spectacle with a tropical
                drink in hand, while couples take romantic strolls along the shoreline. It’s an experience that captures
                the essence of Hawaii — a blend of natural beauty, tranquility, and joyful energy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="beach-heading">A Destination for Everyone</h2>
            <p class="beach-text">
                Waikiki Beach caters to all kinds of travelers. Families can enjoy safe swimming areas and kid-friendly
                activities. Couples find romance in beachside walks, sunset dinners, and luaus. Solo travelers discover
