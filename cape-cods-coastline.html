        <p class="beach-intro text-center">
          Cape Cod is the quintessential American summer destination, where wide sandy beaches, charming seaside
          villages, and fresh seafood create a nostalgic coastal experience. From the historic lighthouses to the
          rolling dunes and Atlantic waters, Cape Cod offers travelers a perfect blend of relaxation, adventure,
          and timeless charm.
        </p>

            alt="Cape Cod Beach" class="img-fluid shadow rounded">
        </div>

        <h2 class="beach-heading">Wide Sandy Shores and Refreshing Waters</h2>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Cape Cod’s beaches are known for their expansive sandy stretches and inviting Atlantic waters.
          Popular spots like Nauset Beach, Coast Guard Beach, and Race Point Beach provide ample space for
          sunbathing, swimming, beach games, and long coastal walks. Each beach has its own unique character —
          some are bustling with activity and lifeguard services, while others are quieter and perfect for
          those seeking solitude.
        </p>
        <p class="beach-text">
          The Atlantic Ocean here is refreshing and invigorating, ideal for swimming, surfing, or simply wading
          in the waves. Early mornings and late afternoons are especially serene, offering peaceful moments
          perfect for reflection or photography.
        </p>

        <h2 class="beach-heading">Exploring Historic Lighthouses</h2>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Cape Cod is home to many historic lighthouses that dot the coastline, serving as both functional
          maritime guides and iconic landmarks. Visiting lighthouses like Nauset Light, Chatham Light, and
          Highland Light provides insight into the region’s rich maritime history. Climbing these towers offers
          breathtaking panoramic views of the beaches, dunes, and villages, making for memorable photo
          opportunities and a deeper appreciation of Cape Cod’s coastal charm.
        </p>

        <h2 class="beach-heading">Charming Seaside Villages</h2>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Beyond its beaches, Cape Cod is known for picturesque seaside towns filled with quaint shops, galleries,
          and cafés. Villages like Provincetown, Chatham, and Wellfleet showcase colorful New England architecture
          and offer a relaxed pace that invites visitors to wander and explore. Walking through these streets, you’ll
          find artisan crafts, local boutiques, and historical landmarks that capture the essence of Cape Cod’s
          coastal life.
        </p>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Many villages host summer festivals, art exhibitions, and farmers’ markets, adding to the local charm
          and creating opportunities to engage with the community while enjoying fresh local flavors.
        </p>

        <h2 class="beach-heading">Fresh Seafood and Waterfront Dining</h2>
        <p class="beach-text">
          No Cape Cod experience is complete without indulging in its fresh seafood. Waterfront cafés and
          family-owned restaurants serve classic dishes like lobster rolls, clam chowder, and fried clams.
          Dining with a view of the Atlantic or a scenic harbor enhances the experience, allowing travelers
          to savor the region’s culinary offerings while soaking in the coastal ambiance.
        </p>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Many local seafood shacks have been serving Cape Cod favorites for generations, providing a true taste
          of New England’s culinary heritage. Evening dinners by the water, paired with a glass of local wine or
          a cold craft beer, make for perfect summer nights.
        </p>

        <h2 class="beach-heading">Outdoor Adventures and Nature Exploration</h2>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Cape Cod isn’t just about relaxing on the sand — it offers a wealth of outdoor activities. Visitors
          can kayak through salt marshes, sail along the coastline, or bike the Cape Cod Rail Trail, which
          spans over 25 miles through scenic landscapes. Hiking trails along the dunes and nature preserves
          provide chances to spot local wildlife, including birds, seals, and occasional whales offshore.
        </p>
        <p class="beach-text">
          For families and nature enthusiasts, exploring Cape Cod National Seashore is a highlight, offering
          protected landscapes, visitor centers, and educational programs that deepen appreciation for the
          area’s natural and historical significance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="beach-heading">Perfect for a Nostalgic Summer Escape</h2>
        <p class="beach-text">
          Cape Cod captures the essence of a classic American summer, combining natural beauty, cultural
          heritage, and coastal charm. Whether you’re strolling along the dunes, cycling through small towns,
          or enjoying a lobster roll by the shore, the experience evokes nostalgia and creates lasting memories.
        </p>

          secluded beaches to lively village events, Cape Cod’s balance of activity and relaxation makes
