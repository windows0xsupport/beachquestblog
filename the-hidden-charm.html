                    blend of dramatic landscapes, peaceful shores, artistic culture, and unforgettable outdoor
                    experiences.
                    This timeless Oregon gem attracts travelers from around the world who come to witness its iconic
                    Haystack
                    Rock, charming village atmosphere, and stunning ocean views.

                <h2 class="beach-heading">A Coastline That Feels Like a Painting</h2>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Cannon Beach is well-known for its dramatic and cinematic coastline. As you walk along the soft
                    sandy
                    beach, you are greeted by towering cliffs, rolling waves, and the majestic Haystack Rock rising
                    proudly
                    out of the ocean. This 235-foot sea stack is more than just a natural wonder—it’s a symbol of the
                    Oregon
                    coast and a favorite landmark for photographers, painters, and nature enthusiasts. The scenes here
                    feel
                    almost surreal, especially during sunrise and sunset when the sky washes the coastline in warm
                    golden
                    tones. Whether you’re capturing memories with your camera or simply taking in the view, Cannon Beach
                    delivers a serene and unforgettable atmosphere.
                </p>

                <h2 class="beach-heading">The Magic of Haystack Rock</h2>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Haystack Rock is the heart of Cannon Beach and one of the most recognized natural formations in the
                    Pacific Northwest. At low tide, visitors can explore the surrounding tide pools, which are home to a
                    thriving ecosystem of colorful sea stars, anemones, hermit crabs, and vibrant marine life. The rock
                    is
                    also a protected bird habitat, with tufted puffins, cormorants, and gulls frequently seen nesting on
                    its
                    steep edges. Whether you’re watching birds in flight or observing marine life up close, Haystack
                    Rock is
                    a living classroom for anyone fascinated by nature.
                </p>

                    over the country. If you love art, culture, and coastal charm, this beach town will keep you

                    rhythmic
                    sound of waves, or sitting quietly as the sun dips below the horizon, Cannon Beach offers moments of
                    quiet reflection that stay with you long after you leave.
                </p>
